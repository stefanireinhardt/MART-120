        <h1>Better Late</h1>
        <h3>A Short Story<br />
          by Stefani Reinhardt</h3>
        <p>Sophie White had always loved her cluttered office with its stacks of tattered books, and collection of<br />
          wall clocks. It was a place where she felt completely at ease.<br />
          <br />
Though she was a recluse of a woman, she was held in high regard by her close friends who trusted<br />
her with all their secrets.  She preferred red wine and charcuterie to a traditional supper as she almost<br />
always had her evening meals in the seclusion of her home office.  The warn leather of the great<br />
armchair that flanked her wooden desk shaped perfectly to her backside after years of use.  She never<br />
married which suited her just fine. Wifely duties only served to distract her from her true passion.<br />
Writing. Sure, there were nights when she thought the loneliness would swallow her whole.  But she<br />
reminded herself of all she achieved and potentially would not have had she stayed with the only man<br />
that ever tempted her. She thought Chase Taylor was that person for her.  But her strong will<br />
ultimately pushed him away in the end.<br />
<br />

Sophie walked over to the window and reflected on her past. The rain hammered against the glass.<br />
<br />
A movement across the street caught her eye. She tried to focus on the object through the sheen of<br />
wet. She locked on something in the distance, or rather someone. Her breath caught in her throat<br />
and her blue eyes widened.  It was the figure of Chase Taylor. Was her mind playing tricks on her?<br />
Chase was a strong man with a lean physique and piercing green eyes.
Sophie gulped.<br />
<br />
She was not prepared for Chase.<br />
<br />
Stepping away from the window, she headed for the front door.  As Sophie stepped outside and Chase<br />
came closer, she could see the vulnerability in his expression.<br />
<br />
Chase looked down at her with an adoring gaze that for some odd reason reminded Sophie of her<br />
childhood dog and how he would look at her when she came home from school.  He said, in hushed<br />
tones, "I’ve missed you, Soph.”<br />
<br />
Sophie gaped back, more anxious than she thought possible at this age.  The cold rain dampened her<br />
cheeks and sobered her to finally speak.  “Chase, what are you doing here,” she replied.<br />
<br />
He let out a breath and said, “I realized something yesterday.  I realized I met the love of my life when<br />
I was just a boy, at a time when I wasn’t old enough to understand what that meant.  I’m here because<br />
once I realized that person was you, I couldn’t imagine spending another moment without you.”<br />
<br />
They stared at each other with a strange sense of familiarity.  It had been years since they’d spoken<br />
last, yet Sophie felt like no time had passed at all.  They were still just two kids, swaying to the sound<br />
of his mother’s Miles Davis records in the attic of his house.  Sophie regarded Chase thoughtfully.<br />
"I feel the same way."<br />
<br />
The smile that he bestowed upon her had Sophie smiling back giddily.  She blinked past the rain and<br />
found his lips on hers in an instant.  They went inside and Sophie poured them each a glass of red wine.<br />
